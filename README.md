I'm Edmund Miller, I'm a PhD candidate, I have a broad range of interests, primarily in Functional Genomics. Through that interest I got into bioinformatics after realizing I didn't have golden hands at the bench during undergrad. That taste of programming experience got me dabling in writing smart contracts and web apps and I cut my teeth on that. Through my research experience I aquired a taste for processing data with workflows of the reproducible and high-throughput varietal. I saw the light in March 2020 when I found nf-core and tossed aside the reptilian workflow manager for Nextflow. I love a good crossover episode of technologies and I'm always trying to push to the envelope.
