 Hello :wave: , my name is Ketki Joshi. I'm a PhD candidate at UT Dallas, I have a broad range of interests, primarily in Functional Genomics and Biostatistics. Through my research experience I aquired a taste for processing data with workflows of the reproducible and high-throughput varietal.I love a good crossover episode of technologies and I'm always trying to push to the envelope. 

Technically, my degree program is in “Molecular and Cell Biology” but my main focus is functional genomics. To study it I use bioinformatics and computational biology techniques.

My actual research project is to better understand the role of distal trans SNPs and their role in regulating distal target gene. To do this I’ve developed a highly reproducible pipeline to generate gene expression prediction model by utilizing spatial Hi-C to capture distal trans-SNPs. Using those results I’m then working to better understand the function that trans SNPs play on a genome wide scale and their association with complex disease like Alzheimer Disease
